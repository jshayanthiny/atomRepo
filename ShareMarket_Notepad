Pip - Last before decimal
Point - Last unit of decimal
1 pip = 10 Points
1.18165 --> 1.18175 --> the change is 1 pip and 10 points.
1 lot = 100,000 units of currency
Mini lot = 10,000 units
Micro lot = 1000 units


If EUR/USD = 1.18165
1 lot = 118,165 USD
1 mini lot = 11,816.5 USD
1 micro lot = 1181.65 USD

Leverage 1:500
Can trade lot by using 236.38 USD because of the 1:500 leverage. --> 118,165/500 = 236.33

How to calculate your potential profit?
Cost of 1 pip -->

1 pip for 1 lot : 100,000 units of base currency * 0.0001 USD = 10 USD --> 10 pips for lot : 100 USD (1.18165 to 1.18265)
1 pip for mini lot = 10,000 * 0.0001 = 1.0 USD
1 pip for micro lot = 1000 * 0.0001 = 0.1 USD

How many USD do you need to buy 100 EUR, if the price of EUR/USD is 1.15103? 115.103
What will be your profit amount if you sell 0.5 lot of EUR/USD and the price falls down by 1 pip? $10 Wrong ($5 right answer)
What is Leverage? A special loan provided to a trader at the moment of opening an order.

Currency pairs --> Base currency and quote currency --> EUR/USD (USD/AUD --> to buy 1 USD you need to spend x amount of AUD).


For Micro..
$2000 investment without leverage.
You open a buy order at the price 110.872 and hold the trade for about 37 hours until you close it at 112.482. During that time, the price has increased by 161 pips.
The price of a pip, in this case, is $0.18.
This way you have earned $28.98. ($0.18 * 161).

For Lot..
$2000 investment with leverage. ($100,000)
You open a buy order at the price 110.872 and hold the trade for about 37 hours until you close it at 112.482. During that time, the price has increased by 161 pips.
The price of a pip, in this case, is $9.09.
This way you have earned $1463. ($9.09 * 161).

Margin - is an amount of money on your trading account required for opening new positions and keeping initiated trades open - broker needs to be sure that you are capable to cover a potential loss of the trade.
If the leverage is 1:50; the margin amounts to 2% of the order volume.
If the leverage is 1:100 the margin amounts to 1% of the order volume.

Account Equity - to track the outcome of your trades altogether --> It represents the account value that you will have had if all your orders were closed at that time.
Equity = Account balance + Open order's profit - Open order's loss

Margin level shows whether your equity is enough to support your open orders.
If your equity becomes less than a margin required for all of your opened orders, you will get a margin call.

Margin Level = Equity/Margin * 100%;
Whenever you open a new order, make sure your margin Level is 500% or higher. It is a good practice to keep your margin Level at around 1000
Account Balance = $2000; Equity = $1978; Margin Level = 989%;
Account Balance = $2000; Equity = $2039; Margin Level = 1020%;

Margin Level < 100% --> Danger zone
Margin Level = 25% --> The margin call will be triggered --> so you need either to top up your account balance or to increase the equity or close the position and fix the loss.
Margin Level = 15% --> The stop out will be triggered --> your orders will be closed automatically.

Margin call - is a notice from your broker triggered when your losses are about to become bigger than your margin.
